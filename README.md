### **To-Do List App**
A to-do list app helps users manage their tasks by allowing them to add tasks they aim to complete within a specific timeframe.

### **About** 
I'm working on a series of templates for various projects. The goal is to monitor my progress and use these projects as a reference for future updates. I welcome feedback to help me identify and improve any inefficient or non-standard practices.

**Current features for this version**
- Simple CRUD operations
- Toast Notifications 
- Dark & Light Mode Toggle
- Minimal UX Transitions

Stay tuned for more updates - this project is currently in 'beta' / beginner friendly. Regardless, I still consider this is my note taking practice and some sort of progress tracker. Will add & improve more features soon. This project is still made using HTML-CSS-JS hence, it is open source and can be used by aspiring computer enthusiast.
